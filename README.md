# Localization Project

## Project Overview

This work presents a Pose-Based EKF SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) approach using the Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The research focuses on the application of scan-matching techniques on a Kobuki Turtlebot platform.
The proposed algorithm combines sensor data from a 2D lidar, IMU, and wheel encoders to perform real-time mapping and localization.
Experiments were conducted in both simulation and real-world environments to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the
algorithm. While the results in the real-world experiments did not meet expectations, the simulation experiments demonstrated excellent
mapping and localization accuracy. Additionally, a novel pose deletion approach called the MJP approach was proposed to manage the
size of the state vector while preserving crucial pose history information.
